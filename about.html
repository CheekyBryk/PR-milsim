		<div class="fullabout"><H1>AMERICAN MILSIM IS HIGHLY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE TOP MILSIM EVENT ORGANIZERS IN THE COUNTRY.</H1>
		<p>The company was founded by devoted players of the sport with a wealth of experience creating a fast-paced, competitive and intense Milsim experience. Since inception, the company continues to stick to its values and commitment to ensure each event is delivered with the best Milsim experience.</p>
		<p>Over the years, we have made great friends all over the world. Players gather in small Wyandotte, Oklahoma for a fun weekend of camping, friendship and comradery over Memorial Day Weekend. Our goal is to ensure everyone, no matter what your level of airsoft experience, has equal opportunity to undertake the Milsim experience as equals on the battlefield.</p>
		<p>What makes us unique, we are not here to relive history, we are making history. We provide a dynamic storyline that will continue to write itself by the player. The victors of every event will write this open-ended storyline with each and every victory. With this liquid style of play, there will be no more scripted outcome, no more predetermined winner and the only thing that will prevent you from winning is the other team’s drive to not be defeated.</p>
		<p>American Milsim gives you the freedom to take your Milsim experience to the next level. Everyone has the ability to seek out and enjoy what American Milsim delivers without limitations. We deliver exciting scenarios never used before; helicopters providing players with the ability to experience arial combat missions, to players using APCs and Deuces. So, what does “American Milsim” mean to you? We invite you to join us at one of our events and experience American Milsim for yourself. We want to hear from you and together, we can take the Milsim experience to the next level.</p>
		<p>With D-DAY Adventure Park’s 1000 acres and numerous military installations on our tentative schedule, we are striving to grow American Milsim and its new Linear Gameplay mechanic to a completely new level.</p>
		<p>Please feel free to contact our staff at any time with any questions or concerns. Thank you for visiting American Milsim and we hope to see you at an event in the near future!</p></div>
